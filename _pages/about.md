Namaste üôè. I am a second-year undergraduate student at [Vanderbilt University](https://vanderbilt.edu), pursuing a double major in Computer Science and Mathematics along with a minor in Electrical and Computer Engineering.

At Vanderbilt, I am actively engaged in research with the [Huang Lab](https://yuhuang-lab.github.io), under the mentorship of [Prof. Yu Huang](https://yuhuang-lab.github.io) and [Yifan Zhang](https://coderdoge.com). I am also part of the [Vanderbilt AI Negotiation Lab](https://www.ainegotiationlab-vanderbilt.com), collaborating with [Prof. Ray Friedman](https://business.vanderbilt.edu/bio/ray-friedman/). Currently, I am working on a new research project aimed at advancing the mathematical reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs).

Beyond academics, I co-founded and lead [NPL Coder](https://nplcoder.org), fostering computational innovation in Nepal by mentoring students, providing resources, organizing Olympiads, and working to secure Nepal‚Äôs membership in the IOI. I also co-founded Uunchai, providing underprivileged communities with skills in STEM and the humanities.
